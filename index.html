                <p>I grew up on the Navajo Reservation in northeastern Arizona until the ninth grade. I then went to
                    school for my freshman and sophomore years in Massachusetts. Then I finished high school at
                    Holbrook high school back in Arizona. I enrolled at Arizona State University my freshman year
                    and then moved to Flagstaff where I took more courses. I eventually moved to Mesa and finished
                    up at ASU with a degree in geography. I then went on to work for 21 years with the US Geological
                    Survey in both Flagstaff and Tucson. Working with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) got me in the door but eventuallyI did some front and back-end web development in support of
                    the National Geologic Map Database while working as a member of a team. We used a lot of
                    open-source software and I pretty much got by with a VI editor to make code and relied on my web
                    browser to fix bugs. Eventually I left the Survey and figured I could do so much more in web
                    development if I were to be exposed to the proper tools and make a dedicated attempt to learn.
